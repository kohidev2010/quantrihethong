✅ 1) Windows 10 Will Install Some Drivers Automatically

Windows 10 includes a basic set of generic drivers.

It will often install basic functionality for common devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, display at low resolution).

However, these drivers might lack full features or optimal performance.

✅ 2) Drivers You Should Check/Install Manually
Right after installing Windows 10, you should download and install the latest drivers from your motherboard/laptop/computer manufacturer’s support website, especially these:

🔹 Chipset drivers

Critical for motherboard communication, power management, USB stability, PCI devices, etc.

🔹 Graphics driver (GPU)

Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA driver for full resolution, hardware acceleration, and gaming.

🔹 Audio driver

Realtek, Conexant, or other audio chips to enable proper sound quality and microphone functions.

🔹 Network drivers (Ethernet & Wi-Fi)

LAN driver (for wired internet)

Wireless/Wi-Fi driver (for wireless connectivity)

🔹 Touchpad driver (laptops)

For full touchpad features like gestures and scrolling.

🔹 Storage/RAID drivers (if applicable)

Needed if your laptop/PC uses Intel RST or RAID — without it, SSDs in RAID mode might not be recognized or optimized.

🔹 Bluetooth driver

Even if Windows installs a generic one, the OEM driver often unlocks better stability.

🔹 Other device drivers

Card readers, fingerprint readers, special function buttons (hotkeys), or webcam drivers.

✅ 3) How to Check Missing Drivers
After installing Windows:

Open Device Manager.

Look for any devices with a yellow exclamation mark ⚠️ or listed under “Other devices” — these need drivers.

✅ 4) Where to Get Drivers

Best: Laptop/PC manufacturer’s official website (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo support pages).

Alternative: Directly from Intel, NVIDIA, AMD websites for GPU/chipset.

Avoid sketchy driver sites — they often bundle malware.
